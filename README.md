This is nassims option pricing model shared in the lecture. The below link gives the python notebook along with details of what can it do. The option data is the real data used in the class. You can change the inputs and see how the outputs change. Nassim's option formula can be started from simple single group of options and can be made as complex as possible, kindly look at the paper shared by him.
His pricing depends mainly on the alpha parameter (EVT) & from the place where tail region starts, both parameters can be changed to develop intuition of what is happening.
