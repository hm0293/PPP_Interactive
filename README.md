# PPP_Interactive
GUI of Primer Courses by Prof Raphael Douady (This is not official or validated by him, sharing only with Primer students) 
These are the hill estimators of the class shared to fit tails of EVT. You can play with  parameters and see how the hill estimator changes, how your estimation depends on the same. 
There is other paper by Clause et al. (On fitting power law tails) which can be gained insight into deeply fitting tails. 
In order to estimate whether the data is power law or exponential approach by Dr Cirillo (as happens in PPP lectures) can be used (its interactive version will be uploaded in another branch soon)
